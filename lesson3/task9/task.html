There are a lot of useful string methods. You can use the 'lower()' method to get rid of any capitalization in your strings.
The 'upper()' method is used to make a string uppercase. To call any string method, type a dot after the string (or a variable containing the string)
and the method name after it, e.g. "John".upper(). In PyCharm, you can explore all available string methods by using Ctrl+Space after a dot.
